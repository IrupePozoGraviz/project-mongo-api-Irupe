Project Mongo API
This repository contains a project that focuses on creating an API with MongoDB integration. The goal of the project is to learn how to work with Express, model data using Mongoose, store and query data in MongoDB, handle errors, and ensure secure storage of sensitive information.

The Problem
To approach the problem, we utilized Express and Mongoose to create API endpoints and interact with the MongoDB database. We followed the provided resources, including videos and documentation, to understand the concepts and implement them in the project.

Our approach involved:

Understanding the fundamentals of MongoDB and Mongoose
Modeling data using Mongoose schemas
Creating RESTful endpoints to handle CRUD operations
Implementing error handling techniques to provide useful error messages
Securely storing sensitive information such as database passwords
Fetching data from the MongoDB database using Mongoose
Seeding the database with large amounts of data
To plan our work, we followed the provided schedule and attended the team sessions, live coding sessions. I also utilized the available resources, such as videos and documentation, to deepen our understanding of the concepts.

If I had more time, we would focus on the following next steps:

Implementing additional routes and endpoints to handle more complex operations
Accepting query parameters to filter and sort the returned data
Implementing pagination using skip() and limit() to handle large datasets
Exploring advanced features of MongoDB and Mongoose, such as aggregation pipelines, for more efficient data operations
Overall, the project allowed me to gain practical experience in building an API with MongoDB integration and further develop our skills in working with Express and Mongoose.
